<p>Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.</p>

<h4>Why Dynamic Programming</h4>
● Overlapping Subproblems <br>
● Why calculate the answers for the subproblems again and again<br>
● DP helps covers all possible cases (DP V/S Greedy)<br>
